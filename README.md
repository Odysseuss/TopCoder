# TopCoder

This is a place to keep my solutions to TopCoder challenges. 

Although I don't believe  that I have the skill to compete in the timed versions of these challenges, I like to attempt them at my own pace. I focus on the algorithms more than the timing and try to make the logic more readable.

Hopefully, if you have come here to get an idea of how to solve something or just to see how someone else solved a particular problem, the code is laid out in such a way that that is easily possible.
