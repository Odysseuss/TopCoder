# TopCoder

This is a place to keep my solutions to TopCoder challenges. 

Although I don't believe  that I have the skill to compete in the timed versions of these challenges, I like to attempt them at my own pace. I focus on the algorithms more than the timing and try to make the logic more readable.

Hopefully, if you have come here to get an idea of how to solve something or just to see how someone else solved a particular problem, the code is laid out in such a way that that is easily possible.

Each package has a class in which the problem statement was solved and a separate test driver class for which to test the cases specified
in the problem statement.
TopCoder classifies the problem statements as proprietary; so, I simply put the link to the problem statement at the top of both
the solution class and the test driver class for reference.
